# Quick start

Twikoo includes two parts: Serverless Cloud Function and Frontend. To integrate Twikoo on your website, you need to deploy Serverless Cloud Function and Frontend at the same time. Please keep both parts the same version when deploying.

- [Serverless Cloud Function Deployment](https://twikoo.js.org/en/backend.html) has various ways, please choose the deployment platform that suits you.
- [Frontend Deployment](https://twikoo.js.org/en/frontend.html) has two different ways, if your website theme supports Twikoo, you only need to specify Twikoo in the configuration file; if your website theme does not support Twikoo, you need to modify the source code to manually introduce Twikoo js file and initialize it. 
- If you have deployed an older version of Twikoo, please refer to [Version Update](https://twikoo.js.org/en/update.html) to upgrade the cloud function and front-end version.
